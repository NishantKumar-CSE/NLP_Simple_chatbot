## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **NLTK**: The Natural Language Toolkit used for processing human language data.
- **Regex**: Regular expressions for pattern matching user inputs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NishantKumar-CSE/NLP_Simple_chatbot.git
